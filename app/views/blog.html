    <p>Being a first-time blogger can be an intimidating experience. Are my writing skills up to par? Can I create enough content 
    to warrant a blog post? Is my story of interest to anyone else? This is part of a group
    assignment for the Front End Engineering Program at Turing School of Software and Design. Another requirement? Contribute
    to an open source project and have your changes approved and implemented. Maybe writing a blog post isn't so tough after
    all.</p>
    <p>The first thing to do was to become familiar with the project. My team was assigned a project on GitHub titled Refined
    GitHub. After reading through the readme file, I learned that Refined GitHub's purpose was to enhance the user experience
    on GitHub and add features via browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. The creator, Sindre Sorhus hopes that GitHub
    will notice and implement some of the improvements provided by Refined GitHub. Here are a few examples of those features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to mark issues and pull requests as unread</li>
      <li>The option to wait for checks before merging a pull request</li>
      <li>Clickable references to issues and pull requests</li>
      <li>Links to an issue's closing commit or pull request</li>
      <li>Reaction avatars showing who reacted to a comment next to each reaction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a basic understanding of the intent of the project, my team and I proceeded through
    the installation steps provided by the readme file. Since the functionality of this project was neatly wrapped in a Chrome
    extension, installation was a breeze. However, when I fired up the extension and logged into GitHub, it was not immediately
    apparent that the extension was working. Refined GitHub does not replace the user experience on GitHub, it merely adds some
    useful features. So to an untrained eye such as mine, the added features aren't so obvious. I referred back to the readme
    to browse the list of features for comparison and sure enough, it was working perfectly.</p>
    <p>After several minutes of tinkering and admiring my new power-user version of GitHub, it was time to download the repository and install the required developer
    dependencies. Having never worked on a browser extension before, setup was a little outside the norm for me, but not nearly
    as complicated as I imagined. After installing the required dependencies, we were advised to run "npm watch". A quick peek
    at the package.json file showed that this command was running webpack to continually compile the build as you make changes
    to the extension.</p>
    <p>This is where things get a little interesting. The readme provides additional guidance for loading your
    changes into a temporary extension using the browser's debugging tool. This involved turning off the original extension that
    we had just installed and pointing the debugger to the manifest file that contains our new build. While the build was continuous
    and automatic, it would still need to be manually refreshed in the debugger in order for changes to be reflected in the browser.</p>
    <p>Now that we were up and running, it was time to find an issue to work on. The repo had 98 open issues at the time, so we
    had plenty of options. We would initially filter the issues by the "good first issue" tag, which narrowed the list to 12
    issues. From there, we ruled out any issues that had a pull request or was labelled "under discussion." This would get us
    down to a handful of issues and it was time to start digging in.</p> 
    <p>The first issue to catch my eye was labelled, "updateReleasesCount: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'textContent' of null." Having spent the last eight weeks working with
    promises under varying circumstances, I felt good about being able to resolve this issue. While we were able to identify
    the cause of the problem, we quickly decided to table the issue in search of a problem that didn't involve cryptic (to us)
    regex code.</p>
    <p>The next issue we looked at involved hiding some unwanted activity alerts when a contributor edits wiki documents.
    We looked at the source of these wiki comments and quickly agreed that without access to the GitHub HTML, this would likely
    prove to be a bigger challenge than we were looking for.</p>
    <p>Finally, we came across this issue: "Markdown rich diff tooltip
    appears underneath diff settings bar." This issue was particularly inviting because of how well it was written. The author
    provided steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, actual behavior, a screenshot of the issue, and the author's system
    info (OS and browser versions). We were able to reproduce the issue in less than a minute and it was immediately apparent
    that the solution would involve making some minor changes to CSS--something we all felt confident doing.</p>
    <p>The issue was related
    to a tooltip that displays on hover over a couple buttons. Under very specific circumstances, the tooltip was being covered
    by a sticky header. Our proposed solution was to add a hover pseudo-class on each of the two buttons, temporarily increasing
    their z-index. It was important to use the hover state. If we had simply increased the z-index of the button class, the buttons
    would have also been visible as it should have scrolled under a sticky header (while its container was hidden under the sticky
    header). There was a conversation about potentially moving the tooltip to appear below the button (on its Y axis), but it
    was unclear if the debate had been resolved. Being the new kids on the block, we chose to stay out of it and leave the position
    of the tooltip unchanged.</p>
    <p>We also had a proposed change outside of the scope of the issue. Next to the buttons in question,
    there was another button with a tooltip. This particular tooltip was unaffected by our issue because its Y-position was below
    the button. Our proposal would be to move this tooltip above its button in order to remain consistent across the series of
    buttons. We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves, so we stashed this change in a separate branch. If our original changes
    got merged, we would pitch this change separately.</p>
    <p>One mistake that was made was that we cloned the original repository.
    This creates a local working copy of the project. However, because we didn't have the appropriate permissions for this repository
    to push changes to GitHub, we weren't able to propose our changes. So instead, we forked the repository. This method creates
    a copy of the repository in one of our personal GitHub accounts. This way, we can push changes to a branch on our local account
    until the changes are ready to be proposed. From there, it was just a matter of doing a pull request to the original repository.</p>
    <p>And then we waited.</p>
    <p>After a few days, the owner of the project responded to our pull request with some positive feedback
    and suggested that we wait until others in the community had an opportunity to review the proposed change.</p>
    <p>And then we waited some more.</p>
    <p>About a week later, we got another response. He was able to identify an edge case where part of the tooltip would
    not be visible under a very specific circumstance and indicated that the pull request would need to be revised. In response
    to his rejection, we proposed that the tooltip be moved below the element in this particular case. He accepted the proposal
    and we went back to work.</p>
    <p>We would have to submit our assignment before we officially completed the process. So we didn't
    meet our objective of getting the pull request approved in time. However, we learned a lot in the process.</p>
    <p>Even a fresh junior developer--not even out of school--can find a way to contribute to an open-source project. I felt with all the developers
    out there with more technical knowledge and experience, it would be difficult to find an issue that I was capable of resolving.
    The truth is, there are plenty of contributors that could have resolved this issue in much less time. But those developers
    aren't necessarily looking to spend their valuable time making a minor adjustment to a tooltip.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of opinions
    when it comes to how an application should behave. Even the simple matter of how to display a tooltip can raise a heated
    debate. Go into this process with patience, because it's not likely to happen overnight. When entering a new project, keep
    in mind that you are a guest. Be respectful and listen to what others have to say. Everyone in the community has a common
    goal: to make the project better. With the right attitude, empathy, and perseverance, anyone can dive into an open-source
    project and make a meaningful contribution.</p>
